## Scraping

 - Create Unit testing for:

	  The Elephant.White.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-Japhson is a good example.
	  
	  
	  
## JUNIT
 - For UNIT test and also Swing test create a template folder with the media files, then copy to the test location and execute the tests on top of the test location. 
  When the test is finished delete the test location. The template folder will always be intact.
  
  
 - Create a unit test that invokes the Swing UI and run the application using the real UI and Threads.
