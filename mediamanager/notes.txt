
1) Fix the unit tests errors due to the change to create the year field into the MediaDetail object. (Done)

2) Continue with the implementation of the method: scrapeSearchPageDocument on IMDBMovieScraper

## Scraping

 - Create Unit testing for IMDB and finish with the scraping implementation
   -> Working on this NOW ...

 - Create Unit testing for:
	- scenario when the file name is useless, but the folder name is useful to use during the scraping. 
	  The Elephant.White.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-Japhson is a good example.
	  
	  

## New Features

 - Start working on the browser component !
 
 	- Basic ability to search and scrap media info - 100%
 	
 	- Ability to check whether a movie exists in the local library or not before download

## IMprove

 When actions like scrape again, confirm candidate, move to exclusive folder occur, need to refresh the MEdiaDetailPanel
 


	  
## JUNIT
 - For UNIT test and also Swing test create a template folder with the media files, then copy to the test location and execute the tests on top of the test location. 
  When the test is finished delete the test location. The template folder will always be intact.
  
  
 - Create a unit test that invokes the Swing UI and run the application using the real UI and Threads.


## General improvements

 - Implement a XML configuration file for the application
