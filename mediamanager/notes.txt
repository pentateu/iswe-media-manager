
1) Continue with the implementation of the method: scrapeSearchPageDocument on IMDBMovieScraper
	-> Think to move the IMDBMovieScraper scraper implementation to the script based approach
		- having a generic scraper class based on a pattern that will use a script
		  to perform the scraping
		- use a XML to define a scraper and its script
		  


## Scraping

 - Create Unit testing for IMDB and finish with the scraping implementation
   -> Working on this NOW ...

 - Create Unit testing for:
	- scenario when the file name is useless, but the folder name is useful to use during the scraping. 
	  The Elephant.White.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-Japhson is a good example.
	  
	  

## New Features

 - Start working on the browser component !
 
 	- Basic ability to search and scrap media info - 100%
 	
 	- Ability to check whether a movie exists in the local library or not before download

## IMprove

 When actions like scrape again, confirm candidate, move to exclusive folder occur, need to refresh the MEdiaDetailPanel
 


	  
## JUNIT
 - For UNIT test and also Swing test create a template folder with the media files, then copy to the test location and execute the tests on top of the test location. 
  When the test is finished delete the test location. The template folder will always be intact.
  
  
 - Create a unit test that invokes the Swing UI and run the application using the real UI and Threads.


## General improvements

 - Implement a XML configuration file for the application

## Stuff from my first use 

1) Delete button.. to delete the media.. I had a sample in my lista and i'd like to delete straight away

2) button to say that the media it is actualy in its own folder.. this action will rename the current folder to match the media name

3) When the media is not found and the broser opens.. clean-up the title name before searching in IMDB. Also provide a butto to go to ONEDDL or the prefered scraper/site and perform a search there.

4) Ability to move all media with status OK to a target folder

5) Ability to rename a media file

6) button to play the media..

7) When showing a candidate the Move button is taking into consideration the candidate and not the main media file and it is always enabled.

8) In the media detail panel show
  - Sinopse of the Movie
  - Rating
  - If it has sibtitle files or not
  -
